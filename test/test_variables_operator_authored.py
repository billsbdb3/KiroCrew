``_run_chat`` is the dashboard turn engine, but it is reached from ~22 call sites,
including the Slack linked-thread route, which hands it a channel participant's raw
message. While the expansion gate keyed only on ``is_slash`` and ``_prompt_depth``
-- both satisfied by an ordinary inbound message -- a participant could send
``{{NAME}}`` and read operator config back off the thread.

The transport ratchet in ``test_variables_channels.py`` could not catch this: the
